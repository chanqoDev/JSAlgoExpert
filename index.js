// TWO Number Sum

// Q. write a fn
// input : non-empty array of Integers, integer to represent a Target-sum.
// if any two numbers in the input array sum up to the target sum,
// output : return the nums in an array
// if, no two numbers sum up to the target sum, the fn should return an empty array.

// NOte: Target Sum has to be obtained by summing two diffrent ints in the array; you can't add a single int to itself in order to obtain the target sum.
// There will be at one pair up most.
// The numbers could also be in reverse order

// ex:
// arr = [3, 5, -4, 8, 11, 1, -1, 6];
// tagetSum = 10;

function twoNumberSum(arr, targetSum) {}
