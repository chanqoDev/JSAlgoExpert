// Challenge : Smallest Difference

/**
 * Write a func() that takes in two arrays of integers that are non-empty.
 * Finds the pair of numbers ( one from each array) whos absolute difference is closest to zero. (and)
 * it returns an array contianing these two numbers, with the number from the first array in the first position.
 *
 * NOte: that the absolute difference of two ints is the distance between them on the real number line.
 * Exmaple: the absolute diffenrence of -5 and 5 is 10, and the absolute difference of -5 and -4 is 1.
 *
 *
 * Assume that there will only be one pair of numbers with the smallest difference.
